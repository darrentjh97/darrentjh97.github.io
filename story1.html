        <h2> <strong>Northshore </strong></h2>
        <p> Northshore occupies an area of rich, significant history. It was here that Brisbane's working wharves were established in 1923, resulting in a landmark development in the story of ‘The River City'.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Today, this pioneering spirit lives on. With the revitalisation of the wharves, world-class architecture, technology and innovation to be embedded throughout the precinct, Northshore is setting sail into the future.
